%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Function \code{spree} updates counts and proportions arranged by domains (areas) and a categorical variable (at least 2 categories). This function allows the implementation of the most populare SPREE-type estimations, based on \cite{Purcell, N. J. and L. Kish (1980)}, \cite{Zhang, L.-C. and R. L. Chambers (2004)}, and \cite{Luna-Hernández, A. (2016)}

\arguments{
\item{population_data}{a data frame that with exactly same size as \code{sample_data} (A rows and J columns). It contains also \code{population_domains}, \code{row_margins}, and \code{col_margins}. No NAs are allowed. If this file contains zeros, they are treated as structural zeros, so they will remain as zeros in the output.}

\item{sample_data}{a data frame that with exactly same size as \code{population_data}. (A rows and J columns). It contains also \code{population_domains},\code{row_margins}, and \code{col_margins}.}

\item{population_domains}{a character string containing the name of a variable that indicates domains in the sample data. The variable can be numeric or a factor but needs to be of the same class as the variable named in \code{sample_domains}.}

\item{sample_domains}{a character string containing the name of a variable that indicates domains in the population data. The variable can be numeric or a factor but needs to be of the same class as the variable named in \code{population_domains}.}

\item{row_margins}{a numeric vector with A elements containing the ‘true’ domain sizes in t1. NULL is set as default and the sum by rows in sample_data is used.}

\item{col_margins}{numeric vector with J elements containing the ‘true’ totals for each category. The sum by columns in sample_data is used as default.}

\item{type}{a character string. SPREE version to implement: (i) ‘SPREE’; (ii) ‘GSPREE’; (iii) ‘MSPREE’. If this argument remains empty, the first option is selected. The option ‘MSPREE’ requires J >= 3. If J = 2, the ‘GSPREE’ will be applied.}

\item{B}{number of bootstraps used in the MSE estimation.}

\item{method}{a character string. Specify the method to obtain estimates of
the beta coefficient. This  argument is only required when \code{type} =
‘MSPREE’. The alternatives are (i) ‘ML’ and (ii) ‘IWLS’.}

\item{design_effect}{a character string. If type =‘MSPREE’ and method= ‘IWLS’
are selected, a design effect for the column totals can be provided. A
 vector containing 1’s is used as default.}
}

\details{
For GSPREE Poisson likelihood is used to obtain Maximum Likelihood estimates of the beta coefficient. This option can be also set for MSPREE when specifying ‘ML’ in \code{method}. As an alternative for the MSPSREE, Iterative Weighted Least Squares can be implemented. In this case, a variance estimate is required which is obtain using simple random samplig without replacement and multiplying it by a design effect.
For MSE estimation, a parametric bootstrap is implemented. Population compositions are repeatedly generated from a multinomial distribution.

\value{
An object of class "spree", with the updated population counts and respective uncertainty measures.
